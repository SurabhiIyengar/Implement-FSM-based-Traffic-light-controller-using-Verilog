<summary><b>Introduction: 
A traffic light system is an electronic device that assigns right of way at an intersection or crossing or street crossing by means of displaying the standard red, yellow and green colored indications. In addition, it also works in conjunction with pedestrian displays to assign pedestrian crossing right of way. </summary> <br>
  
A traffic light, also known as traffic signal, stop light, stop-and-go lights, is a signaling device positioned at a road intersection, pedestrian crossing, or other location in order to indicate when it is safe to drive, ride, or walk using a universal colour code. Nowadays, 

1. A red light meant traffic in all directions had to stop.

2. A yellow light meant cross-town traffic would have to slow and,

3. A green light would to go or proceed.

## Indication:

1. Green light indicates that there is no traffic and there is easy flow of vehicles in that route/direction.

2. Red light indicates that there is a traffic jam and that route is blocked for the vehicles to move and,

3. Yellow light indicates that the route has medium flow of vehicles.

Time delays for changing from one state to another is considered as, TMG(from S1 to S2), TY(from S2 to S3), TTG(from S3 to S4), TY(from S4 to S5), TSG(from S5 to S6) and TY(from S6 to S1) and the cycle continues.
